## Homework 1

We aim to predict whether or not tweets are made by realDonaldTrump or BernieSanders. This is a useful task if, say, we want to study a certain population on twitter and we would like to know their political views, or if we want to create a left-right/Bernie-Trump index to use as a variable. The training dataset contains around 2500 tweets from the past few weeks in approximately equal proportions from Bernie and Trump. The test dataset contains 633 unlabelled tweets.
